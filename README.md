opendomo-events
===============

This module contains the event management for OpenDomo OS 2, allowing easy configuration of automatic actions for each system event captured, for instance:

 - Play a sound when error is detected
 - Pack logs when disk is full
  
Each plugin should specify which events can generate, as it's specified in the manual page.
